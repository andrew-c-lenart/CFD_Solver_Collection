# CFD Solver Collection
Hi! I'm Andrew, CFD enthusiast. This is my collection of CFD solvers, including steady-state and transient solvers for incompressible flows (we'll see if we go into compressible).

Feel free to look around, or leave any suggestions with ways I could improve any of my existing codes.

# Collection of solvers

| Method | Problem Type  | Remarks       |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Artificial Compressibility      | Lid Driven Cavity         | Incompressible flow |
| Projection Method      | Lid Driven Cavity           | Incompressible flow, uses Gauss-Seidel SOR to solve linear systems |
